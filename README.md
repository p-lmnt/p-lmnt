## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a software developer in a company where I build point-of-sale (POS) software. 
At the moment, I’m using Objective-C for macOS development, but we are planning to transition to Flutter in the near future.

- 📱 I also develop cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and build APIs with Ruby on Rails.

- 🌱 I’m always eager to learn new technologies. Currently, I’m focusing on improving my skills in Ruby and Swift.

- 🤝 Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or discuss anything tech-related!
